Enabling allow less secure app for Gmail
Enabling less secure apps to access Gmail

Gmail considers regular email programs (like the one we're building) to be "less secure", so in order for our app to get access into your account, your "Allow less secure apps" option must be turned on on your Gmail account.

If you don't allow sign-ins from less secure apps, the email won't be sent as the call to connect to your Gmail account will fail.

Please note that allowing less secure apps can make it easier for hijackers to break into user accounts and devices. Blocking sign-ins from these apps helps keep accounts safe. It will be a good idea to turn it off after you're done testing.
